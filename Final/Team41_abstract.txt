Whonix Automated Testing Suite is a behavior-driven testing framework
developed to access the functionality of Whonix features, behaviors, and graphical
interfaces. As stated by the founder, "...current Whonix development is slowed down
by the time spent on manual testing as well as finding the causes for bugs"[1]. The
contribution of an automated test suite allows for developers to run tests without manually
executing them therefore increasing the efficiency, uniformity, and accuracy of development 
cycles. With the testing suite utilizing Python 3, Dogtail, and Behave, the software suite 
alleviates the tedious task of running individual tests and lets the software undertake 
the role of testing execution. Consisting of feature files and step implementations, a major
benefit of the software is the flexibility in allowing for future and customization feature
tests. In conclusion, our contribution is intended to assist Whonix developers by contributing
a testing suite that automates feature testing and discovery of bugs.
